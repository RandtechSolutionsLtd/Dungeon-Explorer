 My .NET RPG game

## Description
An RPG is one of the major types of personal creative projects that it can be argued, all developers should work on and have as part of their portfolio.

I started work on this in January 2021, although it has been a concept for much longer. Ever since I was a child, I have wanted to create an RPG or Dungeons & Dragons style of game. I have always loved the atmosphere of the medieval type of adventure story world.  My initial forays into this world came from playing on the Acorn Electron and Vic 20 when I was 6 years of age. A little later when I was 9, I discovered Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone's **Fighting Fantasy** epic series of books along with the **Choose Your Own Adventure** books. The escapism that these books offered was unrivalled, and I embraced them along with the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons books (Forgotten Realms and similar worlds) along with their much more serious boxed campaign game sets that I never quite got around to playing in earnest, although I would own several copies of the Dungeon Master's Handbook, and the Player's Guidebook from early versions through to the 5th edition. 

 The interface structure has not yet been determined but it will either be:

 1. a roguelike interface (Nethack, Rogue, etc)
 2. a 3D Dungeon Master interface (based around the Eye of the Beholder game for the Amiga)
 3. a text adventure interface (pure text-based output and then enhance)
